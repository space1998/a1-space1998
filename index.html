        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: mediumseagreen;">Most Spectacular Scientific Theories of All Time</span></h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h4 style="color: mediumseagreen;">What is a Scientific Theory:</h4>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">A scientific theory is an explanation of some aspect of the natural world that can be repeatedly tested, in accordance with the scientific method, by using a 
                predefined protocol of observations and experiments. Established scientific theories have withstood rigorous scrutiny and are a comprehensive form of scientific knowledge.</p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">It is important to note that the definition of a "scientific theory" (often contracted to "theory" for the sake of brevity, including in this page) as used in the 
                disciplines of science is significantly different from the common vernacular usage of the word "theory". In everyday non-scientific speech, "theory" can imply that something is an unsubstantiated 
                and speculative guess, conjecture, idea, or, hypothesis; such a usage is the opposite of the word "theory" in science. These different usages are comparable to the differing, and often opposing, 
                usages of the term "prediction" in science versus "prediction" in vernacular speech, denoting a mere hope.</p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain. As additional scientific evidence is gathered, a scientific theory may 
                be rejected or modified if it does not fit the new findings; in such circumstances, a more accurate theory is then desired. In certain cases, the less-accurate unmodified scientific theory can 
                still be treated as a theory if it is useful (due to its sheer simplicity) as an approximation under specific conditions (e.g., Newton's laws of motion as an approximation to special relativity at 
                velocities that are small relative to the speed of light).</p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">Scientific theories are testable and make falsifiable predictions. They describe the causes of a particular natural phenomenon and are used to explain and predict 
                aspects of the physical universe or specific areas of inquiry (for example, electricity, chemistry, astronomy). Scientists use theories as a foundation to gain further scientific knowledge, as well 
                as to accomplish goals such as inventing technology or curing disease.</p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">As with other forms of scientific knowledge, scientific theories are both deductive and inductive in nature and aim for predictive power and explanatory 
                capability.</p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">Paleontologist, evolutionary biologist, and science historian Stephen Jay Gould said, &ldquo;...facts and theories are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of 
                increasing certainty. Facts are the world&prime;s data. Theories are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts.</p>
            <h4 style="color: mediumseagreen;">Types of Scientific Theory:</h4>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">Albert Einstein described two types of scientific theories, "Constructive theories" and "principle theories". Constructive theories are constructive models for a 
                phenomen: for example, kinetic energy. Principal theories are empirical generalisations such as Newton's laws of motion.</p>
            <h4 style="color: mediumseagreen;">Examples of Scientific Theories:</h4>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">Note that many fields of inquiry do not have specific named theories, e.g. developmental biology. Scientific knowledge outside a named theory can still have a high 
                level of certainty, depending on the amount of evidence supporting it. Also note that since theories draw evidence from many different fields, the categorization is not absolute.</p>

            <h3 style="color: mediumseagreen;">1-General Relativity</h3>
                <p><img style="float: left;" src="https://cosmos-magazine.imgix.net/file/spina/photo/2538/021115_General-relativity_5a.png?
                ixlib=rails-1.1.0&amp;h=422&amp;w=657" alt="Time bending due to mass" width="420" height="270" /><span style="color: #ff6600;">Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity remains an important 
                and essential discovery because it permanently altered how we look at the universe. Einstein's major breakthrough was to say that space and time are not absolutes and that gravity is not simply a 
                force applied to an object or mass. Rather, the gravity associated with any mass curves the very space and time (often called space-time) around it.</span></p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">To conceptualize this, imagine you're traveling across the Earth in a straight line, heading east, starting somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere. After a while, if 
                someone were to pinpoint your position on a map, you'd actually be both east and far south of your original position. That's because the Earth is curved. To travel directly east, you'd have to take 
                into account the shape of the Earth and angle yourself slightly north. (Think about the difference between a flat paper map and a spherical globe.)</p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">Space is pretty much the same. For example, to the occupants of the shuttle orbiting the Earth, it can look like they're traveling on a straight line through space. 
                In reality, the space-time around them is being curved by the Earth's gravity (as it would be with any large object with immense gravity such as a planet or a black hole), causing them to both move 
                forward and to appear to orbit the Earth.</p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">Einstein's theory had tremendous implications for the future of astrophysics and cosmology. It explained a minor, unexpected anomaly in Mercury's orbit, showed how 
                starlight bends and laid the theoretical foundations for black holes.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 style="color: mediumseagreen;"><strong>2-Evolution By Natural</strong></h3>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">Now that we've established some of the fundamental concepts of how our universe began and how physics play out in our daily lives, let's turn our attention to the 
                human form and how we got to be the way we are. According to most scientists, all life on Earth has a common ancestor. But in order to produce the immense amount of difference among all living 
                organisms, certain ones had to evolve into distinct species.</p>
                <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://assets.answersingenesis.org/img/cms/content/contentnode/header_image/theory-of-evolution.jpg" alt="Evoluiton 
                steps" width="1060" height="340" />
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">In a basic sense, this differentiation occurred through evolution, through descent with modification [source: UCMP]. Populations of organisms developed different 
                traits, through mechanisms such as mutation. Those with traits that were more beneficial to survival such as, a frog whose brown coloring allows it to be camouflaged in a swamp, were naturally 
                selected for survival; hence the term natural selection.</p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">It's possible to expand upon both of these theories at greater length, but this is the basic, and groundbreaking, discovery that Darwin made in the 19th century: 
                that evolution through natural selection accounts for the tremendous diversity of life on Earth.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 style="color: mediumseagreen;">3-Quantum theory</h3>
                <p><img style="float: left;" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CBrsWPCp_rs/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Quantum Theory Representing İmage" width="330" height="220" /><span style="color: #ff6600;">Quantum theory ripped the entire 
                fabric of classical physics to shreds, demolished ordinary notions of the nature of reality, screwed up entire philosophies of cause and effect and revealed peculiarities about nature that nobody, 
                no matter how imaginative, could ever have imagined</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 style="color: mediumseagreen;">4-Special relativity</h3>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">In some ways special relativity was not so revolutionary, because it preserved a lot of classical physics. But come on. It merged space with time, matter with 
                energy, made atomic bombs possible and lets you age slower during spaceflight./p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>         
            <h3 style="color: mediumseagreen;">5-Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Einstein's broader theory of relativity told us more about how the universe works and helped to lay the foundation for quantum physics, 
                but it also introduced more confusion into theoretical science. In 1927, this sense that the universe's laws were, in some contexts, flexible, led to a groundbreaking discovery by the German 
                scientist Werner Heisenberg.</p>
                <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://byjus.com/chemistry/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Heisenberg-Uncertainty-Principle.jpg" alt="Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle" width="400" height="200" />
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">In postulating his Uncertainty Principle, Heisenberg realized that it was impossible to simultaneously know, with a high level of precision, two properties of a 
                particle. In other words, you can know the position of an electron with a high degree of certainty, but not its momentum and vice versa.</p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">Niels Bohr later made a discovery that helps to explain Heisenberg's principle. Bohr found that an electron has the qualities of both a particle and a wave, a 
                concept known as wave-particle duality, which has become a cornerstone of quantum physics. So when we measure an electron's position, we are treating it as a particle at a specific point in space, 
                with an uncertain wavelength. When we measure its momentum, we are treating it as a wave, meaning we can know the amplitude of its wavelength but not its location.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h3 style="color: mediumseagreen;">6-Laws of Thermodynamics</h3>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">The British physicist and novelist C.P. Snow once said that a nonscientist who didn't know the second law of thermodynamics was like a scientist who had never read 
                Shakespeare [source: Lambert]. Snow's now-famous statement was meant to emphasize both the importance of thermodynamics and the necessity for nonscientists to learn about it.</p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">Thermodynamics is the study of how energy works in a system, whether it's an engine or the Earth's core. It can be reduced to several basic laws, which Snow 
                cleverly summed up as follows [source: Physics Planet]:</p>
                <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">You can't win.</span><br /><span style="color: #ff6600;"> You can't break even.</span><br /><span style="color: #ff6600;"> You can't quit the game.</span></p>
                <div class="_aOd rg_ilm"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Let's unpack these a bit. By saying you can't win, Snow meant that since matter and energy are conserved, you can't get one without giving up 
                some of the other (i.e., E=mc&sup2;). It also means that for an engine to produce work, you have to supply heat, although in anything other than a perfectly closed system, some heat is inevitably 
                lost to the outside world, which then leads to the second law.</span></div>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">The second statement -- you can't break even -- means that due to ever-increasing entropy, you can't return to the same energy state. Energy concentrated in one 
                place will always flow to places of lower concentration.</p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">Finally, the third law -- you can't quit the game -- refers to absolute zero, the lowest theoretical temperature possible, measured at zero Kelvin or (minus 273.15 
                degrees Celsius and minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit). When a system reaches absolute zero, molecules stop all movement, meaning that there is no kinetic energy, and entropy reaches its lowest 
                possible value. But in the real world, even in the recesses of space, reaching absolutely zero is impossible -- you can only get very close to it.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 style="color: mediumseagreen;">7-Newton's Laws of Motion</h3>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">As long as we're talking about one of the greatest scientists who ever lived, let's move on to Newton's other famous laws. His three laws 
                of motion form an essential component of modern physics.And like many scientific laws, they're rather elegant in their simplicity.</p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">The first of the three laws states an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an outside force. For a ball rolling across the floor, that outside 
                force could be the friction between the ball and the floor, or it could be the toddler that kicks the ball in another direction.</p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">The second law establishes a connection between an object's mass (m) and its acceleration (a), in the form of the equation F = m &times; a. F represents force, 
                measured in Newtons. It's also a vector, meaning it has a directional component. Owing to its acceleration, that ball rolling across the floor has a particular vector, a direction in which it's 
                traveling, and it's accounted for in calculating its force.</p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">The third law is rather pithy and should be familiar to you: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. That is, for every force applied to an object 
                or surface, that object pushes back with equal force</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 style="color: mediumseagreen;">8-Universal Law of Gravitation</h3>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">We may take it for granted now, but more than 300 years ago Sir Isaac Newton proposed a revolutionary idea: that any two objects, no matter their mass, exert 
                gravitational force toward one another. This law is represented by an equation that many high schoolers encounter in physics class. It goes as follows:</p>
                <div class="irc_mimg irc_hic i9U62ZNIrBgU-lvVgf-rIiHk"><span style="color: #ff6600;">F = G &times; [(m1m2)/r&sup2;]</span></div>
                <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">F = G &times; [(m1m2)/r&sup2;]</span><a class="irc_mil i3597 i9U62ZNIrBgU-zixyDjKkw5M" tabindex="0" href="https://img.purch.com/w/640/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzA1My80MzQvaTAyL3NodXR0ZXJzdG9ja18xMjA5MjkxNDYuanBnPzEzNzAzMDA0ODQ=" alt="Universal Gravity Force" width="340" height="300" /></a></p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">F is the gravitational force between the two objects, measured in Newtons. M1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, while r is the distance between them. G is 
                the gravitational constant, a number currently calculated to be 6.672 &times; 10-11 N m&sup2; kg-2 [source: Weisstein].</p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">The benefit of the universal law of gravitation is that it allows us to calculate the gravitational pull between any two objects. This ability is especially useful 
                when scientists are, say, planning to put a satellite in orbit or charting the course of the moon.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>  
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 style="color: mediumseagreen;">9-Archimedes' Buoyancy Principle</h3>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">After he discovered his principle of buoyancy, the ancient Greek scholar Archimedes allegedly yelled out "Eureka!" and ran naked through the city of Syracuse. The 
                discovery was that important. The story goes that Archimedes made his great breakthrough when he noticed the water rise as he got into the tub [source: Quake].
                <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://s.hswstatic.com/gif/10-scientific-laws-8.gif" alt="Archimedes' Buoyancy Principle" width="380 height="225" /></p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">According to Archimedes' buoyancy principle, the force acting on, or buoying, a submerged or partially submerged object equals the weight of the liquid that the 
                object displaces. This sort of principle has an immense range of applications and is essential to calculations of density, as well as designing submarines and other oceangoing vessels.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 style="color: mediumseagreen;">10-Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion</h3>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">For centuries, scientists battled with one another and with religious leaders about the planets' orbits, especially about whether they orbited our sun. In the 16th 
                century, Copernicus put forth his controversial concept of a heliocentric solar system, in which the planets revolved around the sun -- not the Earth. But it would take Johannes Kepler, building on 
                work performed by Tyco Brahe and others, to establish a clear scientific foundation for the planets' movements.</p>
                <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*M404RtJ-BiUgdd2o96cG3g.jpeg" alt="Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion" width="1060" height="490" />
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">Kepler's three laws of planetary motion -- formed in the early 17th century -- describe how planets orbit the sun. The first law, sometimes called the law of 
                orbits, states that planets orbit the sun elliptically. The second law, the law of areas, states that a line connecting a planet to the sun covers an equal area over equal periods of time. In other 
                words, if you're measuring the area created by drawing a line from the Earth to the sun and tracking the Earth's movement over 30 days, the area will be the same no matter where the Earth is in its 
                orbit when measurements begin.</p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">The third one, the law of periods, allows us to establish a clear relationship between a planet's orbital period and its distance from the sun. Thanks to this law, 
                we know that a planet relatively close to the sun, like Venus, has a far briefer orbital period than a distant planet, such as Neptune.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3 style="color: mediumseagreen;">11-Hubble's Law of Cosmic Expansion</h3>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">Let's stick with Edwin Hubble for a second. While the 1920s roared past and the Great Depression limped by, Hubble was performing groundbreaking astronomical 
                research. Hubble not only proved that there were other galaxies besides the Milky Way, he also discovered that these galaxies were zipping away from our own, a motion he called 
                recession.</p>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">In order to quantify the velocity of this galactic movement, Hubble proposed Hubble's Law of Cosmic Expansion, aka Hubble's law, an equation that states: velocity = 
                H &times; distance. Velocity represents the galaxy's recessional velocity; H is the Hubble constant, or parameter that indicates the rate at which the universe is expanding; and distance is the 
                galaxy's distance from the one with which it's being compared./p>
                <pstyle="color: #ff6600;">Hubble's constant has been calculated at different values over time, but the current accepted value is 70 kilometers/second per megaparsec, the latter being a unit 
                of distance in intergalactic space [source: White]. For our purposes, that's not so important. What matters most is that Hubble's law provides a concise method for measuring a galaxy's velocity in 
                relation to our own. And perhaps most significantly, the law established that the universe is made up of many galaxies, whose movements trace back to the big bang.</p>

            <h3 style="color: mediumseagreen;">12-Big Bang Theory</h3>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">If you're going to know one scientific theory, make it the one that explains how the universe arrived at its present state. Based on research performed by Edwin 
                Hubble, Georges Lemaitre and Albert Einstein, among others, the big bang theory postulates that the universe began almost 14 billion years ago with a massive expansion event. At the time, the 
                universe was confined to a single point, encompassing all of the universe's matter. That original movement continues today, as the universe keeps expanding outward.</p>

                Explosion" height="346" />
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">The theory of the big bang gained widespread support in the scientific community after Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered cosmic microwave background 
                radiation in 1965. Using radio telescopes, the two astronomers detected cosmic noise, or static, that didn't dissipate over time. Collaborating with Princeton researcher Robert Dicke, the pair 
                confirmed Dicke's hypothesis that the original big bang left behind low-level radiation detectable throughout the universe.</p>

            <h3 style="color: mediumseagreen;">13-Game Theory</h3>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">Developed for economics, where it has had some successes, game theory didn&rsquo;t quite completely revolutionize that field. But it has been widely adopted by many 
                other social sciences. And evolutionary game theory is an important branch of the study of evolutionary biology. Game theory even applies to everyday activities like poker, football and negotiating 
                for higher pay for bloggers. There is also even such a thing as quantum game theory, which is bound to revolutionize something someday. John Nash won a Nobel Prize for his contributions to game 
                theory, and his troubled life inspired the excellent book A Beautiful Mind. But don&rsquo;t expect to learn anything about game theory by watching the movie version.</p>

            <h3 style="color: mediumseagreen;">14-Information Theory</h3>
                <p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~haimp/it/infotheory.png" alt="Tree symbolizing Binary System"
                with="200" height="300"/><span style="color: #ff6600;">It&rsquo;s not exactly the most revolutionary theory, since there really wasn&rsquo;t a predecessor theory to revolutionize. But 
                Shannon certainly provided the mathematical foundation for a lot of other revolutionary developments involving electronic communication and computer science. Without information theory, bits would 
                still be just for drills.</span></p>

            <h3 style="color: mediumseagreen;">15-Oxygen Theory Of Combustion</h3>
                <p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://www.daviddarling.info/images3/Lavoisier_apparatus.jpg" alt="Oxygen theory of combustion" width="450" height="300" 
                /><span style="color: #ff6600;">Lavoisier did not discover oxygen, but he figured out that it was the gas that combined with substances as they burned. Lavoisier thereby did away with the 
                prevailing phlogiston theory and paved the way for the development of modern chemistry. It was a much safer revolution for Lavoisier than the political one that soon followed in France, so 
                revolutionary that Lavoisier lost his head over it.</span></p>

            <h3 style="color: mediumseagreen;">16-Statistical Mechanics</h3>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">By explaining heat in terms of the statistical behavior of atoms and molecules, statistical mechanics made sense of thermodynamics and also provided strong evidence 
                for the reality of atoms. Besides that, statistical mechanics established the role of probabilistic math in the physical sciences. Modern extensions of statistical mechanics (sometimes now called 
                statistical physics) have been applied to everything from materials science and magnets to traffic jams and voting behavior. And even game theory.</p>

            <h3 style="color: mediumseagreen;">17-Plate Tectonics</h3>
                <p style="color: #ff6600;">Wegener realized that the continents drifted 
                around as early as 1912. But it wasn&rsquo;t until the 1960s that scientists put the pieces together in a comprehensive theory of plate tectonics. Wilson, a Canadian geophysicist, was a key 
                contributor of some of the major pieces, while many other researchers also played prominent roles. (Keep in mind that plate tectonics should not be confused with Plates Tectonic, a good name for a 
                revolutionary science-theme restaurant.)</p>
